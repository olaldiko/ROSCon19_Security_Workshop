## Ruffin White <img style="float: right;" src="/img/bio/ruffin.jpg" width="200px">
Ruffin White is a Ph.D. student in the Contextual Robotics Institute at University of California San Diego, under the direction of Dr. Henrik Christensen. Having earned his Masters of Computer Science at the Institute for Robotics \& Intelligent Machines, Georgia Institute of Technology, he remains an active contributor to ROS and a collaborator with the Open Source Robotics Foundation.  His research interests include mobile robotics, with an focus on secure sub-systems design, as well as advancing repeatable and reproducible research in the field of robotics by improving development tools and standards for robotic software.

## Gianluca Caiazza <img style="float: right;" src="/img/bio/gianluca.jpg" width="200px">
Gianluca Caiazza is a Ph.D. student in the Advances in Autonomous, Distributed and Pervasive systems (ACADIA) in security studies at Ca' Foscari University under the supervision of Professor Agostino Cortesi. His research interests include logical analysis of APIs, analysis of complex systems and reverse engineering, always along the line of cybersecurity. He is also passionate about connected and smart devices/infrastructure, specifically within the Consumer and Industrial IoT field.

## Henrik Christensen <img style="float: right;" src="/img/bio/henrik.jpg" width="200px">
Dr. Henrik I. Christensen is a Professor of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of California San Diego. He is also Director of the Institute for Contextual Robotics. Prior to his coming to the University of California San Diego he was the founding director of the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent machines (IRIM) at Georgia Institute of Technology (2006-2016). Dr. Christensen does research on systems integration, human-robot interaction, mapping and robot vision. He has published more than 300 contributions across AI, robotics and vision. His research has a strong emphasis on "real problems with real solutions." A problem needs a theoretical model, implementation, evaluation, and translation to the real world.

## Agostino Cortesi <img style="float: right;" src="/img/bio/tino.jpg" width="200px">
Professor Agostino Cortesi is a Full Professor at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. Recently, he served as Dean of the Computer Science program, and as Department Chair. He also served 8 years as Vice-Rector of Ca' Foscari University, taking care of quality assessment and institutional affairs. His main research interests concern programming languages theory and static analysis techniques, with particular emphasis on security applications. He is also interested in investigating the impact of ICT on different social and economic fields (from Tourism to E-Government to Social Sciences). He has published more than 100 papers in high level international journals and proceedings of international conferences. He served as member of several program committees for international conferences (e.g., SAS, VMCAI, CSF) and on editorial boards of scientific journals (Computer Languages, Systems and Structures, Journal of Universal Computer Science).
