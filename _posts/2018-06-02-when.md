# Monday, 1st October 2018 (14:30-18:00)

Given that ROSCon 2018 will proceed iROS during September 29th-30th, we would like to accommodate as many developer and industry attendees traveling to Madrid for ROSCon to extend their stay. By scheduling this half-day afternoon tutorial towards the start of iROS and thus closer to the conclusion of ROSCon, we hope to entice more of the robotic developer community, those who are underlying drivers in bring the research presented at iROS to market, to join us at iROS as well.

As ROSCon is only single track, outside of keynotes and presentations the community is given only brief informal birds-of-a-feather sessions over breaks to gather and ask questions. We feel a dedication session for instructional walkthrough and Q&A would be valuable for any next generation Robotic Operating System user wishing to learn how to use and deploy secure robotic applications for commercial or industrial sectors. By allocating time for an in-person exchange of lessons and ideas, we hope the accompanying dialogue will help foster and accelerate more constructive solutions than would otherwise be possible from remote or isolated community discussions.
